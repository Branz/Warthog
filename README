WARTHOG REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION

WELCOME
=======

Welcome to Warthog!

Warthog is an experimental cryptocurrency implementation without
specific focus. Don't take this project seriously, it is just 
our hobby experiment.

But beware of bugs: Here be dragons. Almost everything was 
implemented from scratch. We are no experts so don't expect this
software to be rock solid, and don't even expect things to work 
properly. Use at your own risk. There may be and are almost 
certainly are serious bugs! You have been warned.

Have fun with it. Like we had implementing it.

WHAT IS IN THE BOX
==================

* Reference node implementation of the Warthog Network
* Command line wallet software
* CPU Miner

USAGE
=====

* Linux only at the moment
* Compile with meson/ninja
* Run the node (use some restarter in case it crashes)
* Run the miner (compile with release build type for performance)
* Optional: Run the wallet to send funds.
* Good luck and have fun! Use --help the option.

NOTE: We (or some of us) might drop this project any time in case 
      deep/unfixable bugs or ugly design issues arise. Or without
      any reason and without prior notice.
